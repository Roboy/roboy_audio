This file describes the testing procedure for the project of beats detection.

- You can put any mono-channel .wav sound file in the same directory 
as the Main.java and Samples.java lay (or adjust the code). 
- Name your file "song000.wav" and run the program from IDE or from terminal like this:
   - reach the java files' directory
   - execute $javac Main.java Samples.java
   - and then $java Main
